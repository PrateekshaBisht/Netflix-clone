            I have a pet dog, and its name is Jimmy.
            It is of Pomeranian breed and two years old.
            She is white with light brown stripes on her back.
            She looks very cute and adorable and is favourite of every family member.
            Her favourite food is bread soaked in milk and Pedigree.
            She loves to take a bath.
            <!-- especially in the summer and sleeps in the bathroom the whole day in case of extreme heat waves. -->
            <!-- She is generally well-behaving but naughty at times. -->
            <!-- She likes to wear a sweater during winter and feels cosy in it. 
            She welcomes me in the evening and shows her affection by licking my feet.
            She is more than a family member to us, and everyone loves her. -->
